        <p class="text-muted sub-header">The story behind this project</p>
        <p>At University of Ottawa, software engineering students are offered a course called Professional
          Communication and Responsibility. In this course, we were required to develop a business idea then promote it
          with a website and a pitch and compete with the rest of the class. We came up with the idea of a
          cooking app that has dynamic recipes and ingredients that tailors to the taste of the user. For this project
          I spearheaded the design and development of the website.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p class="text-muted sub-header">Designing and Composing the Website</p>
        <p>After planning out the project in a macro-scale, we decided that if we wanted to complete the project, we
          needed to work fast, especially since we have other commitments. Step 1, we started combing through showcase
          sites like awwwards and dribbble for inspirations, then using the inspiration we found, we developed an
          outline for the website. Finally we started painting out a wireframe mockup for the site.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="container full-width-paragraph">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          This entire process took about 3 days, we focused on a wider scope of the website at first, then we slowly
          narrowed down each details, as the lead designer for the website, I engaged the team in discussions on user
          interaction and the looks of the website, ensuring that everyone has their voice in the design and that the
          plan is at a level that everyone is able to implement.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage of the project, we understood the importance of our business idea, while it is completely
          fantastical, it is still the core concept we are promoting. Without a highly sought after product, no matter
          how flashy our website is, it is difficult to promote. So we clarified the details of the product down to the
          miniature details like culture, features, strengths and weaknesses. Using our detailed product plan, we
          started structuring out our website, splitting the pages into sections based on our features, then planning
          web pages that assist the promotion of the app.

        <p class="text-muted sub-header">The Long Path of Development</p>
        <p>
          The development of this project involves two aspects, one is the website. Our team took a long time to polish
          the website since we consider it the front page of our identity. Overall. our team have pushed 119 commits to
          the website. We wrote nearly 6000 lines of code. For the website, I was honored to be given the
          responsibility of developing the overall UI component kit and the home page.
        </p>

      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>
          The website development process mostly went as expected, meaning there was never any bugs or features that
          took too long to build. Thanks to the careful planning and prior experiences, I was able to complete my
          portion of the website ahead of schedule and work on stabilizing the performance of the page to a relatively
          polished degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since a few website ago, I developed an interest for integrating motion design and animation into the user
          interaction aspects of the page. The overall goal is to develop attention grabbing animations that are
          polished, responsive, and not distracting. With these concepts in mind, I implemented several animation
          libraries and developed custom animation keyframes in CSS. The following video is an in development version
          of the website.

          During this time, we also worked on the development of our pitch, this involves finalizing the product
          concept and designing a presentation for the judges and the audience. Like our website, we believed in polish
          over flash, we developed limited demos and focused on selling core beliefs to our audience.
